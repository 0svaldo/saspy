This class is for SAS BASE procedures to be called as python3 objects and use SAS as the computational engine
    This class and all the useful work in this package require a licensed version of SAS.
    To add a new procedure do the following:
    1. Create a new method for the procedure
    2. Create the set of required statements. If there are no required statements then create an empty set {}
    3. Create the legal set of statements. This can often be obtained from the documentation of the procedure.
        'procopts' should always be included in the legal set to allow flexibility in calling the procedure.
    4. Create the doc string with the following parts at a minimum:
        A. Procedure Name
        B. Required set
        C. Legal set
        D. Link to the procedure documentation
    5. Add the return call for the method using an existing procedure as an example
    6. Verify that all the statements in the required and legal sets are listed in _makeProcCallMacro method
        of sasproccommons.py
    7. Write at least one test to exercise the procedures and include it in the appropriate testing file
